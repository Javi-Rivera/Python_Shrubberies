My learning path in python :P

The first book I read into the programing world was Learn Python in one Day and Learn it Well by Jamie Chan it helped me a lot. 

- Learn_Python_in_one_Day_and_Learn_it_Well.ipynb

Now taking coursera classes #stayhome :P

First course: An introduction to Interactive Programming in Python. 

This course gives you the basics for programming in Python, the course assigns games as mini projects at the end of every module. :) 

- An_Introduction_to_Interactive_Programming_in_Python/

I will add the results from all the mini projects until I finish the course.

First mini project: 

- Rock_Paper_Scissors_Lizard_Spock_Miniproject.ipynb

This notebook contains my first mini project that is the game of rock, paper, scissors, lizard, Spock as seen in The Big Bang Theory. Hehehe, hope you enjoy it.

All my notebooks are coded in Python 3.
